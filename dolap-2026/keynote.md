# Keynote by [Prof. Dr. Tilmann Rabl](https://hpi.de/rabl/team/prof-dr-tilmann-rabl.html)

## Title: A Look at the Ecological Impact of Big Data Systems

**Abstract** 

Physical limitations are rapidly bringing hardware efficiency improvements to a halt. At the same time, the AI boom is demanding enormous increases in compute capacity. In the search for marginal profit, industry has mostly given up on former goals of carbon neutrality in a global arms race on AI. In this pivotal moment, research is needed to clear up the clouds hiding the true economic, ecologic, and societal costs of current IT trends to open alternative paths for sustainable computing.

In this talk, we will present current IT trends from an ecological perspective. We will discuss different measures of efficiency of data systems and methods to improve it. Incorporating estimations on hardware and power production carbon intensity, we will estimate ecological impact of hardware and review implications on data system development.
