## Title:   The Symbiotic Relationship between Data Spaces and AI.  Challenges and Trends

**Abstract** 

Two significant trends have significantly changed the global
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data landscape. Recent AI and Machine
Learning developments drive a paradigm shift to creating large
task-agnostic models pre-trained using web-scale data. These
Foundational Models are then adapted to different downstream tasks via
techniques such as fine-tuning. At the same time, we see a movement to
the creation of large-scale data-sharing infrastructures. Data Spaces
are an emerging approach to data management, sharing, and
collaboration at the core of the European Data Strategy. This talk
will explore the symbiotic relationship between data spaces and AI and
delves into the complexities of this relationship, highlighting how
data spaces facilitate the seamless flow of data essential for AI
training. If managed effectively, this symbiotic relationship can
unlock new frontiers in AI research, paving the way for a more
connected and intelligent world. Key challenges discussed include data
privacy, standardisation, interoperability, and the need for robust
data governance frameworks. The talk examines emerging trends such as
neuro-symbolic AI, the rise of synthetic data, and the increasing
importance of ethical and trustworthy AI practices.
