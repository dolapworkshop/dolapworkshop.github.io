# Call for papers

DOLAP accepts short and long paper submissions, moreover this year for the first time we will invite extended abstracts on visions, challenges, and opportunities for artificial intelligence in data analytics.

The best papers presented at DOLAP will be invited to a special issue of [Information Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems). 

- **Long papers** include novel and mature research, industrial, or survey work. Long papers of good quality but not mature enough might be accepted to the workshop as short papers. 
- **Short papers** include (ongoing) novel research works with preliminary results and vision/position papers outlining research issues for future work.
- **Extended abstract** will be invited to present in the interactive panel session, and include initial controversial ideas and visions, reports on early (or negative) results, or reflections on existing and future challenges on the theme of the interactive session. 

The page limit is **8 pages** for full papers, **4 pages** for short papers, and **2 pages** for extended abstracts (in **CEUR format**, double-column, excluding references). Each submission will be reviewed by 3 members of the program committee, the review process is single-blind, and thus authors must include their names and affiliations in submissions. 
Extended abstracts are short papers with an abstract, a main body, and references but have only 2 standard pages of content, references included. 
 
## Interactive Panel Session on: Federated and Distributed Data Spaces

For DOLAP 2025, we solicit extended abstracts about perspectives on exciting and controversial issues of broad interest to the community around the topic of Data Spaces. 
Extended abstracts on this topic can present a vision as well as early or negative results, or comments that can influence recent advancements and research directions. For instance:

- How are Data Spaces transforming traditional data management and analytics paradigms?

- How can we ensure data sovereignty and trust within Data Spaces while promoting data sharing and collaboration?

- How can we address the scalability and performance issues in querying and analyzing data across distributed Data Spaces?

- What are the implications of data analytics on Data Spaces for data privacy, security, and compliance with regulations like GDPR?

- What new opportunities and challenges do Data Spaces present for machine learning and AI applications?

We welcome submissions that explore these questions or related topics, providing insights into the future of Data Spaces and their role in shaping the landscape of data analytics and management.

The panel session will feature **short presentations followed by extensive and interactive discussions** on the presented topics. We encourage the authors to propose topics and perspectives that will engage the audience and ignite debate among the participants. Ultimately, the goal is to tap into one of the original functions of workshops as a forum for discussion, where researchers come together to brainstorm and contribute to paving the way for future research directions.
