<!-- # The DOLAP logo -->

Drawing a logo is not as easy as going to a [random AI-based image generator](https://hotpot.ai/art-generator) and asking to draw a logo for DOLAP (the result is in the banner). After 25 years of workshops, we have revamped the [original logo](/img/dolap_logo_new.jpg) to represent the main themes that are driving the scope of DOLAP.

                    decision-making process, the ground-breaking advancements in the field of artificial

Data-driven decision-making is a research topic in continuous evolution, always encountering new challenges and opening to tremendous opportunities, inspiring research work that takes data analysis to an ever-higher level. The DOLAP workshop is the perfect venue for researchers to share their latest work in this area and join a strong and proactive data-enthusiast community.
