# Call for papers

DOLAP accepts short and long paper submissions, moreover this year for the first time we will invite extended abstracts on visions, challenges, and opportunities for artificial intelligence in data analytics.

The best papers presented at DOLAP will be invited to a special issue of [Information Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems). 

- Long papers include novel and mature research, industrial, or survey work. Long papers of good quality but not mature enough might be accepted to the workshop as short papers. 
- Short papers include (ongoing) novel research works with preliminary results and vision/position papers outlining research issues for future work.
- Extended abstract will be invited to present in the interactive panel session, and include initial controversial ideas and visions, reports on early (or negative) results, or reflections on existing and future challenges on the theme of the interactive session. 

The page limit is 8 pages for full papers, 4 pages for short papers, and 2 pages for extended abstracts (in ACM format). Each submission will be reviewed by 3 members of the program committee, the review process is single-blind, and thus authors must include their names and affiliations in submissions. 
Extended abstracts are short papers with an abstract, a main body, and references but have only 2 standard pages of content references included. 
 
## Interactive Panel Session on: Artificial Intelligence in Data Analytics

For DOLAP 2024, we solicit an extended abstract about perspectives on exciting and controversial issues of broad interest to the community around the topic of artificial intelligence in data analytics. Extended abstract on this topic can present a vision as well as early or negative results, or comments that can influence recent advancements and research directions.

The panel session will feature short presentations followed by extensive and interactive discussions on the presented topics. We encourage the authors to propose topics and perspectives that will engage the audience and ignite debate among the participants. Ultimately, the goal is to tap into one of the original functions of workshops as a forum for discussion, where researchers come together to brainstorm and contribute to paving the way for future research directions.


<!-- 
The success of Big Data and NoSQL solutions has led to a de-escalation of the one-size-fits-all principle. The opportunity to build upon the distinctive strengths of different data models has pushed researchers and practitioners to the development of operational and analytical systems that rely on multiple persistence layers (e.g., polystore, multi-model systems). However, this trend has also opened several research issues, including the discovery, management, and integration of data on separate DBMSs, the study of data modeling best practices, and the capability of running efficient cross-DBMS analytical queries. DOLAP 2023 will devote a special session to Multi-Model Analytics to promote novel contributions in these directions. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to: 

- Multistore and polystore solutions
- Multi-model data warehouse and OLAP
- Heterogenous data discovery, integration, and cleaning
- Data modeling in multi-model systems
- Query evaluation and optimization in multi-DBMS systems
