# Call for papers

DOLAP accepts short and long paper submissions. The page limit is 8 pages for full papers and 4 pages for short papers (in ACM double-column format). Each submission will be reviewed by 3 members of the program committee. The best papers presented at DOLAP will be invited to a special issue of [Information Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems). 
 
Long papers include novel and mature research, industrial or survey work. Long papers of good quality but not mature enough might be accepted to the workshop as short papers. Short papers include:

- On-going: novel research works with preliminary results.
- Vision: position papers outlining research issues for future work.
 
## Interactive Panel Session on: TBD

<!--The success of Big Data and NoSQL solutions has led to a de-escalation of the one-size-fits-all principle. The opportunity to build upon the distinctive strengths of different data models has pushed researchers and practitioners to the development of operational and analytical systems that rely on multiple persistence layers (e.g., polystore, multi-model systems). However, this trend has also opened several research issues, including the discovery, management, and integration of data on separate DBMSs, the study of data modeling best practices, and the capability of running efficient cross-DBMS analytical queries. DOLAP 2023 will devote a special session to Multi-Model Analytics to promote novel contributions in these directions. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to: 

- Multistore and polystore solutions
- Multi-model data warehouse and OLAP
- Heterogenous data discovery, integration, and cleaning
- Data modeling in multi-model systems
- Query evaluation and optimization in multi-DBMS systems-->

## Research topics

Research topics include, but are not limited to:

- Design and Language
- Data management fundamentals: architectures, design, ETL/ELT, modeling, data integration, database design for big data, query processing, maintenance, evolution, security, personalization, and privacy in decision support systems.
- Data Variety: unstructured data (e.g., text), semi-structured data (e.g., XML), multimedia, spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal data, stream and sensor data, semantic Web & deep Web, data lakes, data spaces, data quality, graph data.
- Optimization
- Coping with Volume: physical organization, performance optimization and tuning, scalability, MapReduce and Spark for data analytics, performance optimization of ETL/ELT.
- Coping with Velocity: Deployment on parallel machine, database clusters, cloud infrastructures, smart grid, active/real-time analytics, real-time queries.
- Analytical Processing and Applications
- Analytics and Value: OLAP, data exploration through visualization, recommendation, reformulation, approximate query-answering, personalization, result presentation, data storytelling, graph analytics, process mining, advanced visualization for business contexts. 
- Analytics and Veracity: heterogeneous data integration for analytics, quality aspects of data analysis, exploration outcome and end-user experience, fairness of data analysis, analytics and data driven decision making for the data enthusiasts.
- Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, search engines, predictive and prescriptive analytics.
- Big Data applications: smart city, smart health, smart energy.
