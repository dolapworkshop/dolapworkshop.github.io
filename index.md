DOLAP has established as one of the reference places for researchers to publish their work in the broad area of data decision support systems. 
DOLAP maintains a high quality of accepted papers, as attested by its ranking as "very good event" in the last edition of the 
[GII-GRIN-SCIE Conference Ranking](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgii-grin-scie-rating.scie.es%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3pURkvamEm2oo_dxQnpQpX). 
It features a 2 rounds reviewing process, is associated with special issues of highly reputed international journals (like IS or DKE), 
invites keynotes from reputed speakers, includes a best paper award since 2020, and uses open proceedings since 2017.
 
Research in data warehousing and OLAP has produced important technologies for the design, management, and use of information systems for decision support. 
Nowadays, due to the advent of Big Data, Decision Support Systems (DSS) include a wider range of systems, in which novel solutions combine advanced data 
management and data analytics, (semi-)automating the data lifecycle (from ingestion to visualization). 
Yet, the DSS principles remain the same: these systems acknowledge the relevance of managing data in an efficient way (by means of data modeling and 
optimized data processing) to serve innovative data analysis bringing added value to organizations.
 
DSS of the future will consequently be significantly different than what the current state-of-the-practice supports. 
The trend is to move from current systems that are "data presenting" to more dynamic systems that allow the semi-automation of the decision making process 
(including both data management and data analysis tasks). This means that systems partially guide their users towards data discovery, management 
and system-aided decision making via intelligent techniques (beyond OLAP) and visualization. 
In the backstage, the advent of the big data era requires that new methods, models, techniques and architectures are developed to cope with the increasing 
demand in capacity, data type diversity, schema and data variability and responsiveness. 
And of course, this does not necessarily mean to re-invent the wheel, but rather, complementing the wealth of research in DSS with other approaches. 
 
We envision DOLAP as a forum to discuss, foster and nurture novel ideas around these new landscapes of decision support systems in the era of big data 
in order to produce new exciting results, within a strong, vibrant community around these areas.
