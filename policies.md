This page presents the bylaws established by DOLAP regarding the selection process of Program Chairs (procedures that have been informally followed to this date) as well as the workshop's Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies. Both policies are currently undergoing formal review and confirmation Steering Committee.

# Bylaws

Each DOLAP edition is organized by two Program Chairs (PCs), designated as the First Program Chair (FPC) and the Vice Program Chair (VPC). Each PC serves a non-renewable two-year term, beginning as VPC in the first year and advancing to FPC in the second. These mandates are interleaved to ensure the continuous presence of both an FPC and a VPC.

DOLAP PCs are typically—though not necessarily—senior researchers or early-career faculty members, providing a distinguished synergy between established expertise and an innovation-driven perspective.

Following the conclusion of each edition, the Steering Committee (SC) appoints the new VPC, while the outgoing VPC automatically transitions to the FPC role. Each SC member may nominate one candidate for the VPC position, including self-nominations. The non-renewability of mandates applies without exception. Eligible candidates must be authors of accepted papers in previous DOLAP editions, established researchers in the field, and capable of expanding DOLAP's reach beyond its core community. In the event of multiple nominations, a vote is conducted (excluding the nominees), with the candidate receiving a simple majority being selected.

Program Chairs are included in the SC and continue to serve as SC members after completing their PC term. While this may result in gradual expansion of the SC, it allows for the retention of experienced members who can provide guidance to new PCs and junior SC members.

SC members may step down under the following conditions:
- Voluntary resignation.
- Non-participation in DOLAP for three consecutive years.

# Diversity Equity and Inclusion

DOLAP has always recognized the critical importance of fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment within the scientific community. Efforts are consistently made to ensure diversity among speakers and participants, to support inclusive reviewing practices, and to maintain a welcoming and respectful atmosphere for all attendees.

DOLAP is currently in the process of evaluating formal adherence to [DEI in DB](https://dbdni.github.io/) (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Database Conferences). This initiative promotes inclusive values across dimensions such as age, gender, gender identity, race, cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, and parental or marital status. The SC is actively considering this alignment and will provide updates as the process advances.

Fostering diversity and inclusion is recognized as essential to advancing scientific progress, and DOLAP remains committed to continuous improvement in this area.
