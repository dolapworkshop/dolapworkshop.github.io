This page presents the bylaws established by DOLAP regarding the selection process of Program Chairs, as well as the workshop's Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies. Both policies will undergo a formal review by the Steering Committee over the Summer of 2025.

# Bylaws

Each DOLAP edition is organized by two Program Chairs (PCs), designated as the First Program Chair (FPC) and the Vice Program Chair (VPC). Each PC serves a two-year term, beginning as VPC in the first year and advancing to FPC in the second. These mandates are interleaved to ensure the continuous presence of both an FPC and a VPC.

Following the conclusion of each edition, the Steering Committee (SC) appoints the new VPC, while the outgoing VPC automatically transitions to the FPC role. Each SC member may nominate one candidate for the VPC position, including self-nominations. The SC is strongly encouraged to nominate candidates who have never served as PC in previous years (a good practice successfully implemented over the last 8 years). Eligible candidates must be authors of accepted papers in previous DOLAP editions, established researchers in the field, and capable of expanding DOLAP's reach beyond its core community. In the event of multiple nominations, a vote is conducted (excluding the nominees), with the candidate receiving a simple majority being selected.

Program Chairs are included in the SC and continue to serve as SC members after completing their PC term. While this may result in gradual expansion of the SC, it allows for the retention of experienced members who can provide guidance to new PCs and junior SC members.

# Diversity Equity and Inclusion

DOLAP has always recognized the critical importance of fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment within the scientific community. Efforts are consistently made to ensure diversity among speakers and participants, to support inclusive reviewing practices, and to maintain a welcoming and respectful atmosphere for all attendees.

In light of the traditional co-location with EDBT/ICDT, DOLAP supports the [DEI statement of EDBT/ICDT](https://edbticdt2026.github.io/?contents=DEI_statement.html), promotes inclusive values across dimensions such as age, gender, gender identity, race, cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, and parental or marital status.

Fostering diversity and inclusion is recognized as essential to advancing scientific progress, and DOLAP remains committed to continuous improvement in this area.
